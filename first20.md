# Learning from "The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything" 

During the talk, Kaufman introduces the concept of "rapid skill acquisition" and challenges the notion that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in something. He explains that by focusing on the right things during the initial 20 hours of learning, significant progress can be made in acquiring a new skill.

Kaufman outlines four key steps to effectively learn a new skill within the first 20 hours. **These steps include deconstructing the skill into smaller parts:**
* Focusing on the most important sub-skills, 
* Dedicating uninterrupted time for deliberate practice.
* Obtaining help.
* Guidance when needed.

He emphasizes the importance of deliberate practice, which involves focused repetition and improvement in specific areas. Kaufman also highlights the significance of embracing the discomfort and mistakes that come with learning, as they are natural and necessary for progress.

Overall, Kaufman's talk offers a practical and optimistic approach to learning new skills. By breaking down a skill, focusing on essential components, practicing deliberately, and being persistent, individuals can make significant strides in their learning journey within just 20 hours.

**Based on Josh Kaufman's TEDx talk on learning new skills, here are some steps you can take when approaching a new topic:**

1. **Deconstruct the skill:** Break down the new skill or topic into smaller, manageable parts. Identify the essential components and sub-skills that make up the larger skill.

2. **Focus on the fundamentals:** Determine the most important sub-skills or aspects of the topic that will give you the most significant progress and understanding. Prioritize your learning efforts on these fundamental elements.

3. **Dedicate focused time:** Set aside uninterrupted time for deliberate practice. Create a specific schedule or routine to consistently work on the new topic, dedicating focused and concentrated effort during these practice sessions.

4. **Practice deliberately:** Engage in deliberate practice by actively and intentionally working on the identified sub-skills. Focus on improving specific areas through repetition, feedback, and targeted practice.

5. **Seek guidance when needed:** Don't hesitate to seek help or guidance from experts, mentors, or resources that can provide insights and support in your learning journey. Utilize books, online tutorials, or courses to supplement your understanding.

6. **Embrace discomfort and mistakes:** Understand that learning something new can be challenging and that making mistakes is a natural part of the process. Embrace the discomfort and learn from your errors, as they are essential for growth and improvement.
