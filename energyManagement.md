## 4. Sleep is your superpower

### Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in detail.

The speaker starts with the ill effects of sleep deprivation on the reproductive health of humans. Sleep is also very important in the learning process. We need adequate sleep before learning something in order to grasp things better. An experiment was conducted in which there were two groups of people, one with adequate sleep and the other sleep deprived. It was found out that the sleep deprived group had around 40% reduced brain ability to make new memories. 
When we are in deep sleep, the brain waves transfer our memories from the temporary to the permanent section, making retention better. 

Sleep also has a direct impact on ageing. People age faster if they continue to loose sleep. Sleep has a direct impact on our cardiovascular system as well. Lack of sleep increases the chances of heart attack. Sleep deprivation leads to an increase in car crashes, road accidents and suicide rates. 

Sleep deprivation reduces the natural killer cells in our immune system making us vulnerable to diseases. Just a 4 hour decrease in sleep can reduce the natural killer cells in our immune system by around 70%. Thus, sleep deprivation has a direct relation with cancer risk in humans. The shorter the sleep, the shorter is the life. Sleep reduction also disrupts our gene activities. Thus, sleep has an impact on all aspects of our well being.

Finally, the speaker gives tips for better sleep which includes regularity of sleep and reducing the room temperature as it makes it easier to fall asleep.

- Having a fixed timetable for sleep
